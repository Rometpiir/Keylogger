This is a simple keylogger written in Python that:
- Logs all keystrokes to a file
- Takes a screenshot
- Copies clipboard content
- Saves all output directly to your Desktop
- Stops automatically after a timer or when pressing ESC(can be changed)


When you run the script, the following files will appear on your Desktop:
- `key_log.txt` â€” all keys you typed
- `screenshot.png` â€” a screenshot
- `clipboard.txt` â€” copied text from clipboard
- `system.txt` â€” basic system information
